## A bit about me

Hello everyone! I'm Vladg24, a begginer programmist in JAVA, Lua and C++. I'm creating operating systems for OpenComputers mod.
I began creting OSes because I didn't like the MineOS system after (![IgorTimofeev](https://github.com/IgorTimofeev "His page")),
so I decided to make an analog of Windows OS family.

## My Repositories


The full list of my OSes you can find here: https://github.com/Vladg24YT/OpenComputers (Every OS has it's own branch)
But in this repository my main OS is situated: OC-DOS (OpenComputers - Disk Operating System). 
To be honest, it is OpenOS with the syntax of DOSBox and some commands even are not supported.
